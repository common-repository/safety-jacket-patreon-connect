A safety jacket for Patreon Connect

== Description ==
A time may come when your copy of Patreon Connect is de-activated or not running. When that time comes, its a good idea to have backup. Safety Jacket will ensure your Patreon Content is hidden - even when Patreon Connect isnt functioning. This is the safety net.

[Patreon Connect](https://uiux.me "Patreon Connect") allows users to login to your websites with Patreon. You can restrict access to content by setting a default contribution level. You control who can see what.
